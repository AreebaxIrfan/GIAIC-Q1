// Today learn about the Variable...11 March 2024
// Variable means changeable.. variable is used to store anything..
// variable with let and const (preferred over var);

const myName = "Areeba Irfan";  // value doesn't change, so use const
const myMsg = "Hi! my name is isfhan ahmed";  // value doesn't change, so use const

let mySon = "musa";  // this will change, so use let
mySon = "haroon";

console.log(mySon);
